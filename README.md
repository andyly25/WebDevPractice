# WebDevPractice
I don't know why, but studying Java drives me nuts, so I'm back here to 
study and set a more solid foundation in Web Development through The 
Web Developer Bootcamp. 

I'll still switch back and forth between studying/playing around with Java, Web Development, or Python.

## Current lessons/assignments

2. j013 - j017 intro to Bootstrap
