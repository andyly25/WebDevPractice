# Intro to API
- What is API?
    - Application Programming Interface: interface for code and computer to talk to one another
    - a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and apps
    - web API's communicate via HTTP: e.g. twitter, fb, weather, reddit, and etc
    - [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) Helps you connect APIs together
    - [programmableweb](https://www.programmableweb.com) Have a vast list of APIs
- Data formats:
    - when we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get HTML back
    - APIs dont respond with HTML, but with data, not structure
        - use simpler data formats: **XML**, **JSON**, etc
- XML:
    - Extended Markup Language
        - similar to HTML, but does not describe presentation like HTML
        - encodes key value pairs
- JSON: 
    - looks like JS objects, but everything is a string
    - more popular than XML now because JS apps can access data from JSON easier
- `curl` is a way to make requests to the command line
