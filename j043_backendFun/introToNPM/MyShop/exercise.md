# another NPM exercise
- create directory MyShop
- add file listProducts.js
- install faker package
- read faker docs and figure out how it works
- Use faker print out 10 random product names and prices
- run file with node and see if it works

##Weird... this time node_modules only contained just faker after doing:
- npm init 
- then npm install faker --save-dev
