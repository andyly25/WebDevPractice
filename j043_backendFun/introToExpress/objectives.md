# Intro to Express

- What is a framework? how is it different from a library?
    - library is code that someone else wrote that we can include in our app.
        - collection of functionality that you can call
    - framework is pretty much similar to library, but how they are used is different
        - control flow already in framework, but some predefined whitespots for you to fill in with your code.
    - Main difference is inversion of control
        - when you call a library you are in control, framework where it calls you
            - Hollywood Principle: Don't call Us, We'll call You (first time heard this XD)

- What is Express?
    - a webdevelopment framework, most widely used node framework and a lot of tutorials
- Why are we using Express?
    - Express is a very lightweight framework
        - context: heavyweight is where a lot of things filled in for you and you only get very small portions to fill in for yourself
        - you have a lot more freedom and know what you want.
